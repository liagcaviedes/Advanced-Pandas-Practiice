## Introduction
Welcome to the **Pandas Exercises Collection**! 
This repository contains a comprehensive set of exercises designed to enhance your understanding and proficiency with the Pandas library in Python. Whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your data manipulation skills, this notebook provides valuable hands-on experience.

## Getting Started
To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pandas-exercises.git
   cd pandas-exercises

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Anaconda, Jupyter Lab).

3. Run the Notebook: Open Pandas_Exercises.ipynb and execute the cells sequentially to work through the exercises.

## Exercises Overview

The exercises are structured to cover various aspects of the Pandas library, including but not limited to:

- Data Import and Export: Loading datasets from CSV files.
- Data Manipulation: Creating and modifying Series and DataFrames.
- Statistical Analysis: Calculating statistics such as mean, median, and percentiles.
